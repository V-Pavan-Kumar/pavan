// Naming conventions for class names and method names
public class Name {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        String text= """
        In Java, the naming conventions for class names and method names are as follows:

        Class Name Naming Conventions:

        1. Class names should start with a capital letter.
        2. Use nouns or noun phrases.
        3. Avoid using abbreviations unless widely accepted (e.g., HTML, API).
        4. Use camel case (e.g., MyClass, PrintWriter).
        5. Avoid using reserved words (e.g., class, interface).

        Examples:

        public class Employee {}
        public class HelloWorld {}


        Method Name Naming Conventions:

        1. Method names should start with a lowercase letter.
        2. Use verbs or verb phrases.
        3. Describe the method's action.
        4. Use camel case (e.g., calculateSalary, printMessage).
        5. Avoid using reserved words.

        Examples:

        public void calculateSalary() {}
        public void printMessage() {} 
        
        Variable Name Naming Conventions:

        1. Variable names should be meaningful and descriptive.
        2. Use lowercase letters, digits, and underscores (_).
        3. Avoid using reserved words (e.g., class, interface).
        4. Variable names should start with a letter, not a digit.
        
        Examples:

        String name = "Pavan";
        int myCount = 0;""";
        System.out.println(text);
    }
}
